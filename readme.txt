This is my submission for the howtocodewell.net coding challenge for Regex.

Languages used PHP, CSS and HTML.
Compatible with PHP version 5.6 and above.

As required, the levels are broken down into five scripts:

level1.php
level2.php
level3.php
level4.php
level5.php

An index.php page is also supplied to navigate between the levels. 

All levels have an input form to test the values.

The brief for the challenge is as follows:


Regex Tests

Let's work on some regex. Using this set of numbers 123-939-7878 complete the following levels.

    You can use PHP, Python or JavaScript for this challenge.
    Create one answer per level.
	

Level 1 - The simplest way

Yes, this is a trick question. What is the simplest way to check for EXACTLY this set of numbers? Remember the simplest way is not always the correct way ;)


(For levels 2 and above, use a number pattern of 123-939-7878 rather than the exact value)


Level 2 - Character classes

Use character classes to check for the numbers. You can also use sets if you want


Level 3 - Short hand only

Now simplify the answer using short hand syntax. You can also use sets if you want


Level 4 - Group those numbers

Let's turn those numbers into groups.


Level 5 - You see hyphens I see brackets

What happens if the hyphens are sometimes open and closed brackets like this:

(123)(939)(7878)

Or like this

(123)-939-(7878)

Adjust your answer to cope with hyphens and/or brackets.
